# Contributing to the unofficial LaunchDarkly SDK for Godot

LaunchDarkly has published an [SDK contributor's guide](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/sdk/concepts/contributors-guide) that provides a detailed explanation of how our SDKs work. See below for additional information on how to contribute to this SDK.

## Submitting bug reports and feature requests

I maintain this repository by myself. I monitor the [issue tracker](https://github.com/brooswit/godot-ld-client-sdk/issues) in the SDK repository. Bug reports and feature requests specific to this SDK should be filed in this issue tracker. I will respond as soon as possible.

## Submitting pull requests

We encourage pull requests and other contributions from the community. Before submitting pull requests, ensure that all temporary or unintended code is removed. Don't worry about adding reviewers to the pull request; I will review them myself.
